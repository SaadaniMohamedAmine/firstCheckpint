    First checkpoint:
    
    
    I-How does the web work?
    
    Before answering this popular question,i have to clear the difference between the internet and the web:
    The internet is just a network of networks,in few words is just a networking infrastructure ,where a huge number of devices are connected to the network .
    In the other side ,the web stands for the way that anyone(clients,browsers,server) access to the internet,in few words ,an information sharing-model built on top of internet.
    So,the procedure of the web will be defined in four steps linked and executed in a specific order.
    1-First of all,a client is searching to access to a web content.
    He entered a url(uniform resource lovator) in the search bar.
    In this step, the browser fetches the IP(internet protocole) address from the DNS server.This DNS server is a service ,whish its main function is to translate the domain name into an ip adress,in few words it is obligatory to asociate eatch conncted device,website and any content to an IP address.
    2-the time that the IP adress is ready and resolved,the browser sent a request to the server via the protocole of HTTP(HyperTextTranferProtocole) that defined how the data is sent and how the server will submit the answer of the request.
    3-Once the response is sent to the browser,it will be parsed by this engine.Based on what the answer contain ,the browser will decide hat to do.
    4-The final step is the displaying of the content.Through an API(the acronym of Application Programming Interface),the response will be interpreated and diplayed in the right way that it hould be analysed to the customer. 
    
    
    
    
    II-What do you need to be a web developper ?
    
    The web developpment is huge doamin interacted and connected  to the internet (also the web ) and its interactions.So,it is baesed on three parts:
      --Client-side scripting
      --Server-side scripting
      --Databases managment
      *Client side scripting:is the part,in wish the developper create interfaces valuable to the UserExperience(UX),in summaring,manipulating the visible side of the site by the users.
      This part is more known as the front-end developpment.It required the masterig of three technologies,HTML,CSS and JavsScript, that defined the basic structure of the internet.
      --HTML:stands for HyperTextMarkupLanguage.
      It defines what the web content is througn multiple tags attached to some attribute(for example;you whant to create a paragraphe or multiple lines you will include this aragraph into a paragraph tag)
      --CSS:Stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
      It defines how the web content should be displayed .It works simply,after targetting the element that you want to make style with many selectors,you define the properties and its values .
      --JAvaScript:A programming language responsable for the dynamic part of the web site.Just define how the content and the users will interact with each other.
      ----These three parts works in conjunction in scipes of code.----
      *Server-side scripting:in this part,the web developper will manipulate and configurate the hidden part or the unvisible part of the web site.Most known as the back-end.
      It required the mastering of one programming language and its framework to facilitate the work.(ex:Python,PHP,NODE,RUBY,C#...)
      *The database technology
      In this part,the developper will desigh or plan how does the informations will be stored and manipulated.Through a DBMS(DataBaseManagementSystem),this scripter will organise and configurate how the user will access to the information,how he will interact with it and how it will be woring in harmony in real time.
      
      
      
      
      3-What is the role of web developper?
      
      According to clients and market specifications and restrictions,the web developper is conditerated like an artist that can create websites (from Scratch) or working on existing website to inmprove its functionnality.Just manipulating the layout,the functionnality and the interaction of the user with the interface of the site and the server (DB).
      In other words,the architekt that organise the interface of the web to the customers.
